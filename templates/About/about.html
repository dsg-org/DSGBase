    <h2>What is DSGBase?</h2>
    <p>
      DSGBase is a modern web-based system for managing personal identity data —
      such as full name, district, and ID number — in a clear and organized way.
      It offers a responsive and easy-to-use interface that works directly in
      the browser.

    <p>
      DSGBase allows users to add, view, and organize personal information
      through core sections like <strong>Description</strong>,
      <strong>Base</strong>, and <strong>profile</strong>. Each entry includes
      searchable attributes, making your data easily accessible and manageable
      online.

    <p>
      DSGBase runs in the browser and can store data locally or connect to a
      server, depending on your setup. While it's not designed for sensitive or
      encrypted storage, it avoids unnecessary data sharing and encourages
      responsible use and hosting.

      <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>C</strong>, combining web and
      low-level technologies to ensure performance, flexibility, and
      scalability.
